# Project Alpha (Wakatime API)

## Technologies Used
This project was bootsrapped with Nuxtjs.
Vue Chakra UI was used as against Vuetify or Bootstrap because none is as modular and light-weight as Charka UI
The buildt-in JavaScript fetch API was used for API call in favour of axios or jQuery to reduce bundle size and improve performance
This project is hosted on [Netlify](https://wakatime.netlify.app/)
